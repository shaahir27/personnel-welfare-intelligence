"""Extract acoustic features from a preprocessed waveform.

One job: measure eight properties of *how* a voice was produced.

    f0_sd_hz                         pitch variability across the utterance
    speaking_rate_syllables_per_sec  syllable nuclei per second
    pause_ratio                      share of the recording that is silence
    intensity_rms_mean               average loudness (context only)
    intensity_rms_sd                 loudness variability (context only)
    intensity_rms_cv                 loudness variability relative to level
    jitter_local_pct                 cycle-to-cycle variation in pitch period
    shimmer_local_pct                cycle-to-cycle variation in amplitude

None of these is a word, a phoneme, or anything derived from one. There is no
transcription, speech-to-text, phoneme recognition, keyword spotting or
language identification anywhere in this module or this package. The
information this file can extract is bounded by construction: from an
autocorrelation lag, a period mark and an RMS envelope, the content of speech
simply is not recoverable. That is the point.

    Why autocorrelation rather than a learned pitch tracker:
        It is a closed-form signal-processing operation with no trained
