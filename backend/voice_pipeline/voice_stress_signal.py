"""Reduce a check-in to one number: how far it departs from the person's baseline.

One job, and a strict output contract. **This is the only thing that leaves
the voice pipeline.** A single 0-100 deviation value per (person, snapshot),
plus the metadata needed to say whether it can be trusted.

Nothing downstream ever receives audio, per-feature acoustic values, or the
personal baseline. The scoring path, the officer dashboard, the alert rules and
the recommendation engine all see exactly one number and a presence flag. That
narrowness is the module's purpose: it makes it structurally impossible for a
welfare officer's screen to display "your pitch was 12% higher than usual",
which would be both unactionable and intrusive.

What the number is, and what it is not
--------------------------------------
It is a **deviation from the person's own recent norm**, on the same 0-100
scale as every other behavioral signal. It is not a stress score, not a
diagnosis, not a measure of psychological state, and not comparable between
people. Two people with a value of 60 have each departed similarly far from
their own baselines; nothing follows about which of them is more distressed.

Pipeline position:
    ``voice_pipeline/voice_baseline`` -> **voice_stress_signal** ->
    ``behavioral_engine/behavioral_signals`` (as an optional input)

        the configured weights, renormalised over whichever features were
        actually computable.

    Why only one direction counts:
        The same reasoning as in the behavioral engine. Speaking more slowly
        than usual is not something this system acts on, and allowing it to
        contribute a negative value would let one ordinary feature cancel out a
        genuine departure elsewhere in the same blend.
