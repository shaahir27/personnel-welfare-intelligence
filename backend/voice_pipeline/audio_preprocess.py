"""Prepare a raw waveform for acoustic analysis.

One job: framing, energy, and the voiced/silent decision. No feature is
extracted here and no interpretation is made -- this module hands
``acoustic_features.py`` a clean, framed signal and a mask saying which frames
carry voice.

What this module does NOT do, ever
----------------------------------
No transcription. No speech-to-text. No phoneme recognition, no word spotting,
no language identification, no keyword detection. Nothing in this file or
anywhere else in ``voice_pipeline/`` looks at *what* was said. The only
question the whole package answers is *how* the voice was produced. That is not
an implementation detail; it is the constraint that makes a voice feature
acceptable in a welfare system at all, and it is why the module boundary is
drawn here.

Pipeline position:
    ``ingestion/voice_loader`` -> **audio_preprocess** ->
    ``voice_pipeline/acoustic_features``
