"""Build and maintain each person's own acoustic baseline.

One job: hold what this person's voice normally does, so a later check-in can
be compared against themselves rather than against anyone else.

Why the baseline must be personal
---------------------------------
This is not a stylistic preference; it is what makes the voice feature work at
all. Measured on the project's synthetic corpus, the correlation between mean
pitch and the injected strain level is:

    pooled across all speakers   +0.04
    within each speaker          +0.98

Pooled, the signal is invisible -- habitual pitch varies enormously between
people, and that between-speaker variation completely swamps the within-speaker
change. The same measurement, referenced to each person's own history, recovers
it almost perfectly. Any voice feature compared against a population norm would
be measuring who someone is rather than how they are doing, which is both
useless and exactly the kind of profiling this system must not do.

What is stored, and what is not
-------------------------------
A baseline holds summary statistics over the seven scale-invariant comparison
features: a centre and a scale per feature, plus a sample count and a
timestamp. It does not hold audio, does not hold per-sample feature history,
and cannot be used to reconstruct any recording. Raw audio is discarded
immediately after feature extraction
(``settings.RETENTION_RAW_AUDIO_DAYS = 0``).

Pipeline position:
    ``voice_pipeline/acoustic_features`` -> **voice_baseline** ->
    ``voice_pipeline/voice_stress_signal``

        stating plainly: a baseline that adapts will eventually absorb a slow,
        sustained deterioration and stop flagging it. That is precisely why the
        voice signal is one optional input among eight and never a
        determination on its own, and why sustained trends are the job of
        ``post_model_analytics/trend_engine.py``, which works on the risk score
